#First arguement to the read_excel() function is the path arguement. It serves the file arguement to read_csv(), just with a different name.
#Sheet arguement here tells R which sheet of the excel workbook contains the data we want to import.
#Values we pass to the col_types arguement is now a vector of character strings instead of a list of functions nested in the col() function.
#-values that the col_types function will accept are:
#1. "skip" for telling R to ignore a column in the spreadsheet,
#2. "guess" tels R to guess the variable type,
#3. "logical" for logical variables
#4. "numeric" for numeric variables
#5. "date" for date variables
#6. "text" for character variables
#7. "list" for everything else
